SPECIFICATION — PAGE 4  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate representative embodiments of the disclosed systems, devices, and methods. The drawings are not intended to be limiting. In the drawings, like reference numerals generally refer to like elements across figures.  FIG. 1   is a high-level block diagram of a multi-node intimate physiology monitoring system including a plurality of sensing nodes and an associated computing system.  FIG. 2   is an example data-flow diagram illustrating collection of raw signals, feature extraction, generation of privacy-preserving metrics, and presentation of non-anatomical outputs.  FIG. 3   is an example diagram illustrating cross-device correlation between intimate-region signals and physiologic context signals over time.  FIG. 4   is an example diagram illustrating baseline establishment, longitudinal tracking, and time-window comparison using abstracted metrics and confidence indicators.  FIG. 5   is an example embodiment of a first sensing node configured as an all-day/night external tumescence, rigidity, and physiology monitor, including a C-shape or fully enclosed ring configuration and example sensing modalities.  FIG. 6   is an example embodiment of a second sensing node configured as an intravaginal longitudinal physiology monitor for extended wear, including example sensor zones and example artifact rejection using inertial sensing.  FIG. 7   is an example embodiment of a third sensing node configured as a self-scan external geometry measurement device, including example optical flow sensing for length, time-of-flight or lidar sensing for diameter, and optional anti-spoof and artifact rejection sensing.  FIG. 8   is an example embodiment of a fourth sensing node configured as an intraluminal internal geometry, compliance, and contact device, including controlled radial stimulus mechanisms and associated pressure/contact sensing and endpoint sensing.  FIG. 9   is an example embodiment of a fifth sensing node configured as an upper-body physiologic context device, including chest-worn, ring, or wrist-worn embodiments and example sensor suites for cardiac, inertial, respiratory, thermal, and contact integrity sensing.  FIG. 10   is an example user-interface output showing privacy-preserving representations including indices, ranges, and pattern curves without anatomical imagery.  FIG. 11   is an example diagram illustrating privacy-preserving correlation between metrics of a first user and metrics of a second user across a range of pairing contexts including male-to-female, male-to-male, female-to-female, and other pairings.  FIG. 12   is an example workflow illustrating system initialization, wear detection, data collection, baseline establishment, longitudinal tracking, and cross-device correlation across sessions and time windows.
